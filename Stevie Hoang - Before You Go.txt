Damn hey
I know you ain't tryna hear me out but
There's a couple of things I wanna get off my chest
Listen...

I know sometimes you wonder when I'm not there
You feel frustrated thinking that I don't care
Cause I don't, answer my phone
I don't, return your call
I don't, do all the things
That I, once did before
It's just the way I am, let me assure you
Baby nothing could be further from the truth
Sometimes I, be working late
Cause I, gotta write that song
Don't be, too quick to judge(you can)
That somethings wrong
I know I shouldve spend more time
That was my mistake
Girl I don't wanna change your mind
But before you go

Just know that, I wasn't tryna push you away
All I ever wanted, was you to stay
And before you up and leave
I just need you to see
Losing you was not a part of the plan
Know that, I wasn't tryna push you away
And before you go
Just let me say, I'm sorry I could'ntbe that boy
But please believe
All I wanted was... all I wanted was to be your man

Baby understand I never meant to hurt you
And I realized the way that I mistreat you
I'm thinking of all the things, that I could've done
Shouldve, made you believe, that, you were the one
To see you walk away caught me by suprise
I guess you meant more to me than I realized
I wish, I could go back but, what's done is done
So now I guess it's times that we try to move on
I know I shouldve been right there
That was my mistake
Girl I ain't tryna change your mind
I know it's much too late

Just know that, I wasn't tryna push you away
All I ever wanted, was you to stay
And before you up and leave
I just need you to see
Losing you was not a part of the plan

Know that, I wasn't tryna push you away
And before you go
Just let me say, I'm sorry I could'ntbe that boy
But please believe
All I wanted was...
All I wanted was to be your man

I thought I needed time and space
But seeing you walk away
Has made me realize this isnt
How it was supposed to be... ya yeaa

As I'm sitting here alone writing this song
Tryna figure out what the hell went wrong
I remember how we used to be baby
And everything I did that would drive you crazy
I would stay out all night
You go left and I go right
To the studio for confessionals
Sitting right by another fight
You were right
Yes I learned, did like usher and let it burn
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Make you wanna stand three little words
Looking back, it was just that easy
I'm not saying this so that you won't leave me
I just hope you hear the song and believe me

Just know that, I wasn't tryna push you away
All I ever wanted, was you to stay
And before you up and leave
I just need you to see
Losing you was not a part of the plan
Know that, I wasn't tryna push you away
And before you go
Just let me say, I'm sorry I could'ntbe that boy
But please believe
All I wanted was... all I wanted was to be your man

Just know that, I wasn't tryna push you away
All I ever wanted, was you to stay
And before you up and leave
I just need you to see
Losing you was not a part of the plan
Know that, I wasn't tryna push you away
And before you go
Just let me say, I'm sorry I could'ntbe that boy
But please believe
All I wanted was...
All I wanted was to be your man
