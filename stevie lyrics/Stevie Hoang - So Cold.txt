I woke up one night and it hit me
You were gone (You were gone)
Now I'll be the first to admit
That I was wrong (I was wrong)
Cause I never made time
When I pushed your love away
And it's killing me
Cause now it's too late
Since you been away
It's got me all messed up (All messed up)
Cause I couldn't find
Another girl that I could trust (I could trust)
If I had you here
I'd know just what to say
Cause I finally realized my mistakes

If I could do it all over again
I would go back to the time
We were friends
Making love over and over again
And I woudn't let go
Cause without you girl
My heart is so cold (cold)
My heart is so cold (cold)
My heart is so cold (cold)
My heart is so cold (cold, cold, cold)

I can do what I want now
Stay out every night (every night)
I'll be up in the club
Coming home anytime I like (anytime I like)
But I'm tired of spending nights all on my own
And without you girl this house ain't a home
If I been remninscing all the time
Wish I could press rewind
Go back to the last fight
I just wanna make it right

Now I was foolish girl to ever let you go
For what it's worth baby
I want you to know

If I could do it all over again
I would go back to the time
We were friends
Making love over and over again
And I woudn't let go
Cause without you girl
My heart is so cold (cold)
My heart is so cold (cold)
My heart is so cold (cold)
My heart is so cold (cold, cold, cold)

Don't know what to do
Things just ain't the same
Girl I ain't been right
Since you took your love away
Still got your picture on my phone
How I wished you would called
So I could say

If I could do it all over again
I would go back to the time
We were friends
Making love over and over again
And I woudn't let go
Cause without you girl
My heart is so cold (cold)

If I could do it all over again
I would go back to the time
We were friends
Making love over and over again
And I woudnt let go
Cause without you girl
My heart is so cold (cold)
My heart is so cold (cold)
My heart is so cold (cold)
My heart is so cold (cold, cold, cold)
