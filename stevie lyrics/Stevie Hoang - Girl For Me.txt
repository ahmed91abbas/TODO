She's the finest girl that I've ever seen
She'll be on my mind like a melody
No words can't explain what she means to me
No matter what she do, she's just so sexy

From her eyes to her lips, she got it going on
From her thighs to her hips, she's got a player sprung
Every time she walks on by
Shawty got me sayin'

She's the girl for me
Gotta make her mine
She'll be, all I need
Gotta make her mine
And maybe this could be
My chance so I just
Gotta make her mine
Gotta make her mine
Gotta make her mine
She's the girl for me
(the girl for me, yeah yeah yeah)

I'll be thinking about her all the time
Looking things to say up in my mind to
When I see her I'm a get it right
I'm a hide my game on time

The way that she smiles, she's got it going on
The hair and the nails, she's got it all done
Every time I see her face
Shawty got me sayin'

She's the girl for me
(There goes my baby)
Gotta make her mine
She'll be all I need
(Oooo, gotta make her mine)
And maybe this could be
(My chance so I just)
Gotta make her mine
Gotta make her mine
Gotta make her mine
She's the girl for me

And if she tells me away
(Please don't go)
That I did my best to say
(please don't go)
And I didn't miss the chance
For a shot at sweet romance
And then now I'll be on my way
But at least she heard me sing

She's the girl for me
She'll be all I need
And maybe this could be
Gotta make her mine
Gotta make her mine
Gotta make her mine
She's the girl for me

She's the girl for me
She'll be all I need
And maybe this could be
(My chance so I just)
Gotta make her mine
Gotta make her mine
Gotta make her mine
She's the girl for me
