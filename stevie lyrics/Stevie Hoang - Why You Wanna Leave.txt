Oooohh, . She don't love me, no more. Nooo.

See I've been trying to figure out all the things I'm doing wrong.(I'm doing wrong)

But it seems to me girl lately,
All the love is gone.(love is gone)

Now, I don't want to trip and start a fight,
But It's obvious that things are right.

We need to find a way to get things back,
To the way they used to be...

But you say that it's over...
Girl, I ain't trying to hear it, no.

You say that it's over...
And it's time to let it go.


You say you want to pack your bags and leave,
There's no love for you and me.

Was there something I said,
Something I did?

Tell me why you want to leave...

Think about all that we've been through,
And wasn't that always good to you.

Did something go wrong,
I need to know.

Tell me why you want to leave.

Now I'm sitting here trying to figure out, was it you or me.(you or me)
Was it something I said, something I did that make you want to leave.(want to leave)

Won't you tell me what's wrong and I'll make it right,
If you say that it's just another night

We can try to get things back
To the way they used to be

But you say that it's over...
Girl, I ain't trying to hear it, no.

You say that it's over...
