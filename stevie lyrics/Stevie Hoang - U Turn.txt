Check it
Girl tell me how
You got the nerve
To be comin back after all this time
Cause I recall
Girl it was you
Who left me now
You wanna call the shots
Don't you remember
The First of December
Said you are leavin and you wouldn't be comin back
I was so stupid
But I got through it
So now I'm tellin you

It don't matter what you say
It's too little too late
I'm tired of the lies
And the games that you played
Tellin me you wanna come back
But it's not goin down like that

It don't matter what you do
Girl I'm sayin we're through
It's over now I don't wanna hear no excuse
So be on your way
There's nothin to say
Don't you know it's time for you to learn
There's no u turn
U turn 
There's no u turn
U turn 

Look in my eyes
And you will see
I'm no longer the boy you used to know
I hate to say
I told you so
But it's funny how now the tables have turned

You had me stressin
Girl I was guessin
Had me believin that I just wasn't good enough
Now you must be trippin
It's me you're missin
But I can't take you back because

It don't matter what you say

It's too little too late
I'm tired of the lies
And the games that you played
Tellin me you wanna come back
But it's not goin down like that

It don't matter what you do
Girl I'm sayin we're through
It's over now I don't wanna hear no excuse
So be on your way
There's nothin to say
Don't you know it's time for you to learn
There's no u turn
U turn 
There's no u turn
U turn 

Listen babe
Now girl you thought you could do much better
It's a shame you had to learn the hard way
Now you and me could never be together
So now I've got to take my love away
It took a while to see
But now I know the truth
And I wanna tell the whole world that we're through

It don't matter what you say
It's too little too late
I'm tired of the lies
And the games that you played
Tellin me you wanna come back
But it's not goin down like that

It don't matter what you do
Girl I'm sayin we're through
It's over now I don't wanna hear no excuse
So be on your way
There's nothin to say
Don't you know it's time for you to learn
There's no u turn
U turn 
There's no u turn
U turn
