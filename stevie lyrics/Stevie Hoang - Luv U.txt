Let me take a minute girl and say whats on my mind
Said I've been wanting you and needing you
I'll be the first to say that I have been so blind
Gotta admit it now cause I don't know how to live without you

Don't really wanna waste your time
But I gotta say whats on my mind
Before you go gotta let you know
Girl you're the only one for me
What can I do to make you see, I need you girl

I just wanna love you, I just wanna love you forever more
I just wanna kiss you , baby can't you see you're the one I want 
Baby I just wanna hold you, I just wanna prove to you my love
I'll love you all your life, promise girl I'll make it right
Love you, Love you babe 

Now, see the truth is girl that I cant tell no lies
Girl I had enough of phony alibis
Baby can't you see you're the only one for me

Don't really wanna waste your time
But I gotta say whats on my mind
just hear me out, oh please don't shout
Girl you're the only one for me
What can I do to make you see
That I have changed, I'm not the same
