Hey
Heyyyy mhmmm
Hey hey 

Love is just a crazy game
You never know what it can bring
So if you have someone
Tell em that you love em
Never ever let it end
Cause you don't know what you really got
Until it's just much too late
So cherish every moment that you spend with em
Promise not to let them go...
Cause girl you had my heart
Right from the very start
But still you gotta know


Even though I told myself that I moved
Deep down I keep on holding on
It's crazy but true
Girl I'm missing you
And although I'm with somebody else
Girl I can't keep lying to myself
And no matter what I gotta face the truth
She just ain't you
She just ain't you...

It don't matter how hard I try
I just can't get you off my mind
It's driving me crazy
Missing you baby
Thinking bout you all the time
Shes everything a man could want
But you're the one I need
To me it's not worth it

Though she may be perfect
She could never be like you...
Cause girl you had my heart
Right from the very start
But still you gotta know baby...


Even though I told myself that I moved
Deep down I keep on holding on
It's crazy but true
Girl I'm missing you
And although I'm with somebody else
Girl I can't keep lying to myself
And no matter what I gotta face the truth
She just ain't you
She just ain't you...

It hurts to move on
Cause your all I ever knew
And I gotta stay strong
So I can't break down and cry
Cry...


Even though I told myself that I moved
Deep down I keep on holding on
It's crazy but true
Girl I'm missing you
And although I'm with somebody else
Girl I can't keep lying to myself
And no matter what I gotta face the truth
She just ain't you

No matter what I gotta face the truth...
She just ain't you...
