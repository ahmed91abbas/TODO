the signs were there, chose not to see it
i keep telling myself not to believe it no
the more i try, the more i was losing
it's crazy how this girl had me stressin' oh

[hook]
i try so hard to make it work everyday
but now i know, we were never really on the same page
convince myself, but i was living a lie
now all i'm left with, girl it's wasted time

[chorus:]
gave you everything i had but now i see
it was never in your plans to stay with me
and i can't believe i thought you were the one
i tried to listen to my heart but instead
i should've listen to my head, my head, my head
should've listen to my head, my head, my head
should've listen to my head, my head, my head
i tried to listen to my heart but instead
i should've listen to my head

[verse 2]
to try to please her, i started changing
blowin' hot and cold, this girl kept me guessin'
caught up without the plans i was making
so glad i never saw her misbehavin'

i try so hard to make it work everyday
but now i know, we were never really on the same page

[bridge]
could of gave the world to make you stay
but to you, our love was just a game
but i know i'll learn from my mistakes
and this won't happen again

gave you everything i had but now i see
it was never in your plans to stay with me
and i can't believe i thought you were the one
i tried to listen to my heart but instead
i should've listen to my head, my head, my head
should've listen to my head, my head, my head
should've listen to my head, my head, my head
i tried to listen to my heart but instead
i should've listen to my head
