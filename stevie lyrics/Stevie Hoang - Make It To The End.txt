Here we are
Standing in the middle of a broken heart
I was strong enough to see the hurting part
And make it right again
Make it to the end

Cause the mystery in keeping love is never giving up

Here we are
Like the candles that was waiting to be out
Like the story that was destined to begin
Can make it right again?
Make it to the end?
Make it to the end

Beautiful things can begin in hard places
We've been giving too much to erase this
We've been giving the chance
And now we should take the chance again
The more I know about giving and trying
The more I know about laughter and crying
The fear I have of losing is nothing compared to losing you

Cause the mystery in keeping love is never giving up

Here we are
Standing in the middle of a broken heart
I was strong enough to see the hurting part
And make it right again
Make it to the end
Make it to the end

I can see the sun in the distance

Then with you I'm willing to finish
Through the rain and the darkness
I'm ready to go the way with you
Cause on the other side of this journey
There's a longing life that is fading
With a love that I've been holding
I'm giving it to you

Here we are (Oh yeah)
Standing in the middle of a broken heart (A broken heart)
I was strong enough to see the hurting part (I was strong enough)
And make it right again (Make it right again)
Make it to the end (Make it to the end)

Here we are (Oh baby)
Standing in the middle of a broken heart (Of a broken heart, yeah)
I was strong enough to see the hurting part
And make it right again (Make it right again)
Make it to the end (Make it to the end)

Here we are
Standing in the middle of a broken heart
I was strong enough to see the hurting part
And make it right again (Cause the mystery in keeping love is never giving up)
Make it to the end
