Yeah... Oh., 
Wow yeah... Ooh... Ahh... 

Babe do what you came to do
You know there ain't nothing to lose
Don't think about it
Just relax your mind
Been working hard from 9 to 5
And now it's time to make it right
Let's get a groove on
And party all night

And if you're feelin' naughty
You can grab somebody
Just let the music take control
Don't be acting shady
Don't you mind some ladies
Now here's your moment
That playing your song

Just make your way onto the dance floor
Babe let yourself go
Cause we came a party
All night long
Now we're here to have a good time
Leave the troubles behind
Cause we gonna party
All night long

The music's popping for the vibe
You know it's going down tonight
No need to find it, just have a good time
The people make you lose control
So get your back up off the wall

No hesitating, tonight is your night

And if you're feelin' naughty
You can grab somebody
Just let the music take control
Don't be acting shady
Don't you mind some ladies
Now here's your moment
That playing your song

Just make your way onto the dance floor
Babe let yourself go
Cause we came a party
All night long
Now we're here to have a good time
Leave the troubles behind
Cause we gonna party
All night long

Just close your eyes and feel your mind
You can do what you want tonight
The DJ is on fire feel the vibe
So get up off the floor

Just make your way onto the dance floor
Babe let yourself go
Cause we came to party
All night long
Now we're here to have a good time
Leave the troubles behind
Cause we gonna party
All night long
