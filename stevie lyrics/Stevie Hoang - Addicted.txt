Since u went away its been one year two months
but it just don't seem like yesterday we were still together
time has passed and things have changed so
why do i feel this way
cause you're with somebody else
and Im with somebody else but

whenever i think about the love we had
it hurts so bad
whenever i think about the love we made
i said that I'd be strong
girl i really thought that i'd move on
but still i find myself asking

do u still think of me like i think about u
do u still dream of me cause i cant sleep without u
tell me if time should make a change
then why do i feel the same
your love has got me addicted
said i dont know
when im with a chick and hittin it girl i call your name
said i dont know
when i be with somebody else i push them away
tell me if time should make a change
then why do i feel the same
i know i gotta move on but im so addicted to u

its been long enough dont know why im still holding on
if i had a wish babe i would turn back the hands of time
cos u dont know what u got untill its gone
its the reason why im writing u this song
girl im slippin and i dont know what to do
girl i admit it, im sick over u

damn i realised my mistake, my pride got in the way
i should have begged u to stay

do u still think of me like i think about u
do u still dream of me cos i cant sleep without u
tell me if time should make a change
then why do i feel the same
your love has got me addicted
said i dont know
when im with a chick and hittin it girl i call your name
said i dont know
when i be with somebody else i push them away
tell me if time should make a change
then why do i feel the same
i know i gotta move on but im so addicted to u

if u ever lost someone u truely love 
let me hear u say yeah
and if u lost someone u truely need
let me hear u say yeah

do u still think of me like i think about u
do u still dream of me cos i cant sleep without u
tell me if time should make a change
then why do i feel the same
your love has got me addicted
said i dont know
when im with a chick and hittin it girl i call your name
said i dont know
when i be with somebody else i push them away
tell me if time should make a change
then why do i feel the same
i know i gotta move on but im so addicted to u
