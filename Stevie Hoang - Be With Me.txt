Hey girl, what's up,
I heard you been going through some things huh?
Why don't you come to see me, we can talk it out.

Baby who *that dude* you do that with, I ain't tryna hate but,
Girl you're much too good for him you should be with me.
I'll show you all the things girl,
You ain't never seen before, so baby just come along
It's obvious I got what you need.

Now I don't mean to come across as rude,
But I think me and you were meant to be together baby.
So give me the chance,
I can prove to you that I can be your man.

Girl I wanna be the one you kick it with every night,
I wanna be the one to love you and treat you right,
I wanna be 'cause he don't love you like he's supposedta, Girl you deserve better,
You should be with me, girl you should be with me.

Baby you don't have to front it's ok if you want it,
I promise I will be right there anytime that you need it.
So baby get ready to do things that you've never done,
Cause I ain't tryna hit and run I wanna be your only one.

Now I don't mean to come across as rude,
But I think me and you were meant to be together baby.
So give me the chance,
I can prove to you that I can be your man,
Girl I wanna be.

Girl I wanna be the one you kick it with every night,
I wanna be the one to love you and treat you right,

(treat you right)
I wanna be 'cause he don't love you like he's supposedta, (you)
Girl you deserve better,
You should be with me, girl you should be with me.

You've been waiting now for far too long,
To find a man who'll never do you wrong,
Girl I feel that I could be the one,
To open up your heart.

I wanna be,
Girl you should be with me, girl I got what you need.
Girl you should be with me, girl I got what you need.

Girl I wanna be the one you kick it with every night,
I wanna be the one to love you and treat you right,
I wanna be 'cause he don't love you like he's supposedta, Girl you deserve better,
You should be with me, girl you should be with me.

Girl I wanna be the one you kick it with every night,
(all the things that he won't do girl)
I wanna be the one to love you and treat you right,
(treat you right)
I wanna be 'cause he don't love you like he's supposedta, (girl you can do much better)
Girl you deserve better,
You should be with me, girl you should be with me.

Girl I wanna be the one you kick it with every night,
I wanna be the one to love you and treat you right...
